I have been asked to give a talk on Family Councils.  I wasn't given any particular direction, so I will be pulling from a couple of M. Russell Ballard's conference talks and from our own family council experiences.


## **Inercessory Prayer**

Let me start with a scripture in **John 17:20-21**.  This is part of what is known as Christ's _Intercessory Prayer_.  It is where he prays on our behalf.

> 20 Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;
>
> 21 That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.

So, we should all strive to be one.  We can be one as a family.


## **String Analogy**

I'm sure you've all heard the analogy where if you take one string and try to break it, it's pretty easy.  However, if you have many strings together, it is much more difficult to break.

Sometimes, as family members, we drift appart and go our own way, even when we are under the same roof.  We are like the single thread of string.  When temptations come our way, we are weak and can be easily broken.

Instead, if we are united as a family, we are stronger and happier.  We will have more strength to overcome the temptations of the world.


## **Strength in Council**

In Elder Ballard's talk called **Strength in Council** he says:

> God called a grand council in the premortal world to present His glorious plan for our eternal welfare. The Lord’s church is organized with councils at every level, beginning with the Council of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and extending to stake, ward, quorum, auxiliary, and **family councils**.

So at first, he reminds us of our first family council.  The one we all had in heaven before coming here.  It was there in that family council that we learned of his plan... the plan of salvation or plan of happiness.

He goes on to talk about how in the general councils he has served in they study the scriptures and pray to have guidance for how to help the auxiliaries be more effective in blessing and strengthening the members.

A family council doesn't have to be exactly like a ward or general church council, but we can take many ideas from those councils and apply them to our family council.

Like any other church council, a family council [read points then discuss]:

- should bring the spirit
- should encourage free and open discussion
- be a time where we can discuss objectives, activities, responsibilities
- try to arrive at mutual
- see that each person is heard

First, what are some things that can bring the spirit

- start with prayer
- include song, spiritual thought, and/or scripture


## **Lead with Love**

We as parents lead the family and family council, but we are not alone.

In another passage from Elder Ballard's talk he says:

> God never intended that His children should stand alone. Children have parents, and parents have the Church, with the scriptures, living prophets and Apostles, and the Holy Ghost, to help them understand proper principles and act upon those principles in fulfilling their parental responsibilities.

We have the church leaders, apostles, prophets, and ultimately our Savior.

How did the Savior lead the church? He served. He washed the apostles feet. He prayed for the people. He loved them.

When we lead our families in family council, we must do so with a spirit of love.  We are there to help our families with there needs.  We are there to help them learn and grow.


## **Family Council Different from Family Home Evening**

In Elder Ballard's talk on **Family Councils** he says:

> Please remember that family councils are different from family home evening held on Mondays. Home evenings focus primarily on gospel instruction and family activities. Family councils, on the other hand, can be held on any day of the week, and they are primarily a meeting at which parents listen to each other and to their children.

He talks about 4 types of family councils:

1. First, a general family council consisting of the entire family.
2. Second, an executive family council consisting of a mother and father.
3. Third, a limited family council consisting of parents and one child.
4. Fourth, a one-on-one family council consisting of one parent and one child.

He goes on to say:

> In all of these family council settings, electronic devices need to be turned off so everyone can look at and listen to each other. During family councils and at other appropriate times, you may want to have a basket for the electronic devices so when the family gathers, everyone—including Mom and Dad—can deposit his or her phones, tablets, and MP3 players in the basket. Thereafter, they can counsel together without being tempted to respond to a poke on Facebook, to a text, to Instagram, to Snapchat, or to email alerts.


## **1. Full Family Council**

Let's talk about the first type of family council that Elder Ballard mentions... the **Full Family Council**.

This type of family council is generally a bit more formal than the other types.  It should start with a prayer, but sometimes may start by natural conversations already started in other settings.  Generally a **Full Family Council** is a time scheduled on a day like Sunday, but can be moved around as needed.

In the Church pamphlet called _Our Family_ it reads:

> This council can meet to discuss family problems, work out finances, make plans, support and strengthen [each other], and pray for one another and for the family unit.

Elder Ballard makes the following recommendation:

> You may want to consider holding the general family council on Sunday, which is the first day of the week; families can review the past week and plan for the coming week. This may be exactly what your family needs to help make the Sabbath a delightful experience.


## **2. Parent Council**

In the second type of family council, just the parents get together to discuss the needs of each child.  It is also a good time to talk each other about your personal relationship with each other.


## **3. Parents and One Child**

In the third type of family council, both parents will meet with one child.  This can be a time to help them make decisions for their future and to make goals. It can be a time to listen to serious concerns and challanges.


## **4. Parent and Child**

The forth type of family council is a one-on-one between one parent and one child.  This type of family council is similar to the third and often _just happens_.  It can be when you are traveling in the car together, or working around the house.  It could also be a scheduled bonding time.  I often like to do Daddy-Daughter dates.


## **Our Family Council**

Ok, now let me talk about our own family council.

While we usually have Family Council on Sunday, we sometimes move it around depending on what's needed.  Sometimes we even have impromptu councils in the middle of the week.

In our family council, we start with a prayer and occasionally we include a song, or a verse of scripture.

We usually start talking about what meals we want to do for the week.  Each of our girls (_and eventually J.T. when he gets older_), has to cook one night that week.  There is a lot of back and forth on what they want to eat and what they want to cook.  Each person usually has a set day they cook, but sometimes it gets switched around depending on what we have going on during the week.

Next we talk about what we have going on during the week.  We set up a shared Google Calendar where we can add different things to let the rest of the family know what we have going on.  When Amber was in volleyball we had all her practices in the calendar. We would schedule time to go to the temple. We scheduled dentist or doctor appointments and pretty much anything else we had going on.

After talking about the events of the week we ask if there are any concerns that anybody wants to bring up.  This sometimes can bring up conversations that can get a little heated... especially when we first started doing family council.  Over time, however, I think we have gotten a lot better about calmly discussing things.

Sometimes we will get to talking about random things and family council will break off into many tangents.  We often find ourselves laughing and having a great conversation.

Sometimes we go right into scripture study at the end and follow up with family prayer.

## **Testimony**

I testify to you of the power of Family Council.  It has been a great blessing in our lives.  It has brought us together and strengthened us as a family.  I am so grateful for my family.  My family is such a blessing in my life.  I can't imagine my life without them.  I am so grateful we can be eternal families.  I am grateful for the plan of Salvation.  I am so grateful for the Savior.
