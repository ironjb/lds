## Mountain Man Rendezvous (MMR)

**WHAT IS IT?**

The MMR is a Longhorn Council event held every other year.  Even though it's a Scout event, it is 95% staffed and attended by LDS folks.  The MMR has outposts that the boys can go to.  Each unit is on their own to go to whatever outpost they want.  Some of the outposts are black powder rifle, archery, tomahawk throwing, knife throwing, dutch oven cooking, popcorn popping, mallet making, and tin smithing.  There are generally 25 to 35 outposts so thee is something for everyone.

**WHEN IS IT?**

Because almost all of the staff and attendees are members of the Church, and because the Church is no longer chartering scouting units after December 31st, we had to be creative when picking the dates for the MMR.  Because of where Christmas falls, we would normally hold the MMR in early January.  But, since very few of us will be registered with the BSA after the 31st, we had to hold the MMR before the end of the year.  So, the MMR will be held on December 26th, 27th, and 28th.

**WHERE IS IT?**

The MMR will be held at Buchanan Springs at Sid Richardson Scout Ranch.

**SCHEDULE:**

We're still working on the schedule but here's a general plan:

Because we are starting on the 26th, you won't need to arrive until 10:00-ish.  The flag ceremony would be at 12:00-ish with the outposts to open after that.  On the 28th, we will hold the Colter Run, then have the award ceremony, then retire the colors and close the event.  The event usually closes by 1:00 or 2:00 on the last day.

Again, we're still working on the schedule but that will give you a pretty good idea of the arrive and leave times.

**COST:**

The cost for the MMR is $30.00 per participant (adult of youth) and $45.00 per staff member.  The staff pays more because their meals are provided.  There is a late fee of $10.00 after December 1st.
