**Eagle Scout Project**

On **Saturday, July 27th**, Brennan Newell will be holding his Eagle Scout project at the [Prairie Mound Cemetery](https://goo.gl/maps/voi5FaAbha5pocLJ8) located at the Harvest subdivision by I-35 and F.M. 407.  Brennan is asking for volunteers to assist with taking pictures of the headstones at the cemetery so they can be uploaded to an international database powered by [BillionGraves.com](http://BillionGraves.com).  This website is used heavily by family history researchers and the work performed will better help connect families to their ancestors.

For those that can make it to this event, the activity will start at **9:00 am** and should be completed by noon.  The cemetery is fairly accessible and the terrain is easy to walk through.  The caretakers have cautioned there are chiggers and other biting insects so they recommend volunteers wear lace up shoes, long socks, and jeans.  Additionally, it will most likely be a typical July day with plenty of sun and heat so a hat and water bottle is recommended as well.

For the photography, please come with a tablet or phone that connects to a cellular network so the photos can be uploaded to the website.

Please join Brennan in supporting him in his Eagle Scout project which also helps family members connect with their history.


Bro. Joe Bell
YM Secretary
