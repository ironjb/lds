		</p>

		<p>As for the <strong>Membership Record Maintenance</strong>, I never really did anything with this since it is in LDS Tools, but if they start asking for it then enter in that info as needed.</p>
		<p>Now email the <strong>HT Report</strong> along with the PDF you downloaded for <strong>Statistics by Month</strong> and <strong>Households Not visited in 3 Months</strong></p>
		<p>You should email the Bishop, EQ President and Bro. Given (Stake High Councilor assigned to our Ward).</p>
